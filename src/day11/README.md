## Notes
More time trying to read the question than anything else, but a fun one for sure.

Part 2 sent me down an optimisation route for a bit, trying to clean my code up and stop using 'eval' for the operation etc.
Running it in the background as I was working on this, I realised it would take more than just some code optimisations, so I threw in a mod-lcm thing and it just worked, magic.
