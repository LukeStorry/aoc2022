## Notes

        for x, y, z in cubes
        if (cubes := set((int(x), int(y), int(z)) for x, y, z in re.findall(r"(\d+),(\d+),(\d+)", open("./src/day18/input.txt").read())))

)
```


Then part2 was a touch fiddly but a simple djik-style search did it nicely, much easier than the past few days have been
