## Notes

I went down a gross enumerated indexing route which really messed me around for part 2, finally got it working but it was [really gross](https://github.com/LukeStorry/aoc2022/blob/be467c9a352dd965ec668f8e280b2647d95e4979/src/day08/__main__.py), had a coffee and then re-did it with slices.
