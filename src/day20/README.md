## Notes

Should have been simple.
Few fun issues meant I nearly missed my train this morning.
Turns out python's `list.insert()` won't append, needs to be special cased for those wraparounds, so did basic string concatenation instead.
And of course the input has duplicates, took me far to long to figure out I couldn't do the `indexOf()` thing, but enumerating the list first to make elements unique tuples sorted it right out.
